# picos_adventure

This is one of the first games I worked on in the GMS2 engine, and so it represents a huge learning experience for me. I find GML quick to learn, easy to use, and one of the best languages for quick 2D game development. 

If you want to play the compiled game itself, you can check it out here:

## Where is the code?

Since this is a GMS2 project, the code can be found inside the game objects themselves. The core of the game logic centers around Pico, the player, and as such you should begin your journey inside obj_player. The player has different behaviours depending on his current state 'AKA: state machine' and so you can find the relevant code inside the scripts folder. The scripts are all sensibly named and making sense of them should be relatively straightforward.

## Why is this on GitHub?

I teach game development and programming on YouTube, and I wanted to share this with viewers so they could learn from my experiences. Please keep in mind that this is one of my first projects, and so this code does not represent best practices or even necesarily what I would teach today. While I have many other, and better, projects I will be sharing in the future - they are not complete yet and I may release them commercially. I will not be releasing Pico's Adventure, and so the source code is free to be used by all.

## What can and can't I use in my own projects?

You are free to use any of the source code in your own projects. I reserve the rights to all art, sounds, images, characters, and title 'Pico's Adventure'. I hope that's not too much of an inconvenience.
